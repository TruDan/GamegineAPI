    This API is being created in order to create compatibility among games using it to allow for multiple games to be run on
    a single server without any problems. This will be especially useful for minigame servers wanting to create a smooth
    experience for their players.

    From past experience, I have found it a pain to install multiple minigame plugins on a single server due to
    incompatibilities that would appear. I'm creating this in the hope that no one will have to deal with those sorts of
    problems in the future.
